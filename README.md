# Titanic-EDA
Exploration Data Analysis on Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas,Matplotlib, and Seaborn
🚢 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.
The analysis focuses on demographic and socio-economic features such as gender, age, and passenger class.
🎯 Objectives
Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
Identify missing values and data distributions
Analyze survival patterns based on different features
Extract meaningful insights using visualizations
📊 Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Rows: 891
Columns: 12
Target Variable: Survived
🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
Data loading and inspection
Understanding data types and structure
Missing value analysis
Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis (Survival vs Gender, Class, Age)
Key insights and conclusions
📈 Key Insights
Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
First-class passengers survived more compared to lower classes
Male passengers in third class had the lowest survival rate
Age had a noticeable impact on survival probability
✅ Conclusion
The analysis shows that survival on the Titanic was not random.
Factors such as gender, passenger class, and age played a major role in determining survival outcomes.
This EDA provides a strong foundation for building predictive machine learning models.
🚀 Future Work
